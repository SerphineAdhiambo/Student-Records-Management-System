# Student Records Management System

## Description
This project is a **Student Records Management System** implemented using MySQL. It is designed to manage student information, course details, and enrollments in courses. The system is a relational database that includes tables for students, courses, and enrollments, with proper relationships between them (one-to-many and many-to-many).

## How to Setup/Run the Project
To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. **Import the SQL File**
   - Download the `StudentManagementSystem.sql` file from the repository.
   - Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin).
   - Create a new database and import the `StudentManagementSystem.sql` file into your MySQL environment.

### 2. **Running Queries**
   - Once the database is set up, you can run queries such as:
     - Adding new students
     - Enrolling students in courses
     - Viewing student records and their courses
